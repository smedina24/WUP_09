# Predicting Fish Weight


## Perch  

```{r}
Fish <- read.csv(file= "Fish.csv")

Perch <- filter(Fish, Species == "Perch")

Perch <- select(Perch, -Species)
```


### Best Models

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="topright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

This chart indicates that the best regression model is the one above the two. Height and weight has the highest Adjusted R 2 value at 0.9400. The second best regression model with the highest adjusted R 2 value is the one above the 3 it is at 0.9390. 

```{r}
Perchmodel <- lm(Weight ~ Height + Width, data = Perch)
summary.lm(Perchmodel)
```

```{r}
Pmodel <- lm(Weight ~ Height + Width + Length1, data = Perch)
summary.lm(Pmodel)
```

After comparing the 3 regression model with the two regression model the summaries indicate that the two regression model has a lower residual standard error and a higher adjusted R- squared value. Thus, confirming that the best regression model is the two regression model.
